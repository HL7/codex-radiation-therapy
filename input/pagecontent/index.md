### Background
Intro to use case.

Need CODEX Boilerplate.

### Overview

Readers should also take note of the [Data Dictionary](dictionary.html), a flattened list of data elements in Microsoft Excel format.

The Data Dictionary comes with several caveats:

* Only [must-support (MS)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) data elements are included. These are elements that implementers could be expected to provide meaningful support for (see [Profile Conformance](conformance-profiles.html) for details).
* Profiles defined externally to this IG, including those in mCODE, are not included.
* Sub-elements of complex types such as CodeableConcept and Period are not explicitly included.


### Development History
This IG is an outgrowth of IHRO and mCODE....or something like that.   Need to flesh it out.


### Sources

In addition to information obtained from subject matter experts, several existing standards, nomenclatures, and guidelines were consulted during the development of this specification. These include:


In addition, material was drawn from the [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) and the [mCODE Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/).

### Understanding this Guide


The page layouts and symbols are explained [in the FHIR documentation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/formats.html). In viewing a profile page, note that there are multiple views. The "Differential Table" view represents the difference between the current profile and its base resource or profile. When interpreting this view, bear in mind that the immediate parent may not be a base FHIR resource, but could be a US Core profile or another profile in this guide. The "Snapshot Table" represents the entire profile, with all elements.

In the event there are differences between the page renderings in this IG and the associated FHIR artifacts, the FHIR artifacts should be taken as the source of truth. In the event that an artifact's snapshot is inconsistent with its differential, the differential should be taken as the source of truth.

Steve Bratt leads the [CodeX FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home), a member-driven community accelerating implementation around mCODE standard. Capability statements were rendered with tools developed by Eric Haas and modified by Corey Spears. Max Masnick wrote the [Data Dictionary generator](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/tree/master/data-dictionary). The raw FSH annotation of the examples was generated by Saul Kravitz using [GoFSH](https://fshschool.org/docs/gofsh/) and this [script](fshtomd.rb).

Codex Radiation Therapy is an open source project and welcomes all contributors. The source code for this IG is maintained in the [HL7 Github](https://github.com/HL7/codex-radiation-therapy). All of the profiling work is done using [FHIR Shorthand](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/) and [SUSHI](https://fshschool.org).
