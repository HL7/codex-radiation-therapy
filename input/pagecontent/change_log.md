### CodeX Radiation Therapy STU2 Changes
* Changed mCODE dependency to [STU4]({{site.data.fhir.ver.fhirmcode}}/index.html)
* Changed USCore dependency to [5.0.1]({{site.data.fhir.ver.hl7fhiruscore}}/index.html)
* Added dependence on [Adverse Event Clinical Research IG STU1.0.1](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ae-research-ig/)
* Adopted Vulcan approach to adverse event severity and grade.
* ServiceRequest profiles are now based on USCoreServiceRequest.
* All extension contexts have been tightened
* [Disease Progression Qualifier](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/codex-radiation-therapy/STU1/StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-progression-qualifier.html) extension has been renamed to [Radiotherapy Disease Progression Qualifier](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-disease-progression-qualifier.html).
* Added [Radiotherapy Treated Fraction](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treated-fraction.html) and [Radiotherapy Treatment Session](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treatment-session.html) profiles to model treatment sessions.
* Added extension [Intrafraction Verification](StructureDefinition-codexrt-intrafraction-verification.html) to all radiotherapy Procedures and ServiceRequest profiles. This extension is used to annotate the procedure that is used to verify the position of the patient during treatment fractions.
* Added a [Radiobiologic Metric](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiobiologic-metric.html) extension to capture a radiobiologic metric of effective dose, as defined by the TG-263. The extension has been added to all ServiceRequest and Procedure profiles, i.e. [Radiotherapy Course Prescription](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-course-prescription.html), [Radiotherapy Phase Prescription](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-phase-prescription.html), [Radiotherapy Plan Prescription](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-plan-prescription.html), [Radiotherapy Planned Course](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-planned-course.html), [Radiotherapy Planned Phase](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-planned-phase.html), [Radiotherapy Treatment Plan](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treatment-plan.html), [Radiotherapy Course Summary](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-course-summary.html), [Radiotherapy Treated Phase](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treated-phase.html), [Radiotherapy Treated Plan](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treated-plan.html), and [Radiotherapy Treated Fraction](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treated-fraction.html).
* Added reference to Device to AdverseEvent.contributor
* Added a DICOM Treatment Session UID (300A,0700) identifier to [Radiotherapy Treatment Session](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treatment-session.html) 
* Procedure.category and ServiceRequest.category: [mCODE STU2.1 RadiotherapyCourseSummary](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/STU2.1/StructureDefinition-mcode-radiotherapy-course-summary.html) had a required Procedure.category value for RadiotherapyCourseSummary that used a SNOMEDCT code ([108290001 Radiation oncology AND/OR radiotherapy (procedure)](https://dailybuild.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=108290001&edition=MAIN&release=&languages=en)) that has become inactive.  mCODE STU3 dropped the Procedure.category binding completely. CodeX RT STU1 required all ServiceRequest.category to include the same SNOMEDCT code.   In CodeX RT STU2, a requirement for a category code has been added to all of the Procedure and ServiceRequest profiles with a required binding to a valueset that includes the old code as well as a new SNOMEDCT code ([1287742003 "Radiotherapy (procedure)"](https://dailybuild.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=1287742003&edition=MAIN&release=&languages=en)).   An invariant warns if the old code is used.
* In the [Radiotherapy Volume](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-volume.html), changed the cardinality of the identifier slice for display name from the 0..1 of mCODE to 1..1. In CodeX RT, the display name is mandatory. The identifier cardinality was already 2..* to reflect the two mandatory slices .
* As discussed and changed in mCODE 3.0.0, some binding strengths were relaxed because required bindings were a barrier to broader implementation. The binding strength was changed from required to extensible on the following elements.
  * bodySite in all Procedure and ServiceRequest (as in the [mCODE STU3 Radiotherapy Course Summary]({{site.data.fhir.ver.fhirmcode}}/StructureDefinition-mcode-radiotherapy-course-summary.html)).
  * [Reason for Revision or Adaptation](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-reason-for-revision-or-adaptation.html)
  * [Free-Breathing Motion Management Technique](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-free-breathing-motion-mgmt-technique.html)
  * [Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT)](StructureDefinition-codexrt-image-guided-radiotherapy-modality.html)
*  Extended the [overview](overview.html) with explanations of the added [Radiotherapy Treated Fraction](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treated-fraction.html) and [Radiotherapy Treatment Session](StructureDefinition-codexrt-radiotherapy-treatment-session.html) profiles, including the newly added section [Session and Fraction Numbering](overview.html#session-and-fraction-numbering).
* Added additional [documentation](representing_radiotherapy_treatment.html) of how radiotherapy data is represented using the resources in CodeX RT and mCODE.
