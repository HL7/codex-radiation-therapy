Su Chen leads the [CodeX FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home), a member-driven community with a core goal of leveraging FHIR-based standards to achieve interoperability within the healthcare community to improve health for all.

Many organizations have been involved in the modeling and defining of the radiotherapy FHIR profiles that are defined in the CodeX RT IG: 

- AAPM
- ASTRO
- MITRE
- Varian, a Siemens Healthineers Company
- COMP
- Telligen
- Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)
- Wemedoo

The RTTD team also receives significant input and participation from:

- University of Michigan
- Veterans Health Administration
- McGill University
- University of Pennsylvania
- Virginia Commonwealth University
- IHE-RO
- Epic
- RaySearch
- Elekta
- University of California San Francisco

The capability statements were rendered using a [script](https://github.com/cspears-mitre/CapStatement) originally developed by Eric Haas that has been extended and maintained by Corey Spears. The generated html is integrated into the FSH source using the [transferdiv.rb](transferdiv.rb) script.

CodeX Radiation Therapy is an open source project and welcomes all contributors. The source code for this IG is maintained in the [HL7 Github](https://github.com/HL7/codex-radiation-therapy). All of the profiling work is done using [FHIR Shorthand](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/) and [SUSHI](https://fshschool.org).
