Title: "codexrt Resource Identifier Code System"
Description: "Concepts describing instance types, to be used in the `code` element of instances. These codes were created because no appropriate concept could be found in established vocabularies. These concepts are analogous to LOINC codes for laboratory observations: they identify the type of thing an instance represents.

Please note that while these codes may imply conformance to the profiles that use them, they are not synonymous with profiles and do not serve the same purpose in a FHIR resource for several reasons:

1. An instance of a resource like Group, Observation, or Procedure may conform to multiple profiles, but may only have one 'type of thing' as determined by the value of `code` (which has a maximum cardinality of 1).
2. `Procedure.code`, `Observation.code`, and `Group.code` elements require a [CodeableConcept data type](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept), which can be satisfied with a code from this code system. In contrast, a profile is identified with a [canonical URL](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url), which is represented by a [URI data type](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#uri). In other words, a profile's canonical URL belongs in the `meta.profile` element, whereas the codes in this code system belong in `Resource.code` elements.
3. The same `code` can correspond to more than one profile (although not the case here)."

Title: "Teleradiotherapy Treatment Phase"
Description: "A summary of a phase of teleradiotherapy treatment that has been delivered. The scope is a treatment consisting of one or multiple identical fractions.  A phase consists of a set of identical fractions. In this context, identical means that each fraction uses the same modality, technique, dose per fraction, and is applied to the same treatment volume or volumes. Because of their spatial relationship or the technique used,  all treatment volumes do not necessarily receive the same total dose during a phase."
