See https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_5.0/NCIt_CTCAE_5.0.xlsx.\n\n**Use of 'Other, specify'**: In the event a suitable CTCAE term cannot be found, the appropriate verbatim term SHALL be captured via the 'Other, specify' mechanism. In this case, the verbatim term is populated into the event.text field, the NCIT code for the body system into the event.coding.code field, and the display string corresponding to the code into the event.coding.display field. For example, if reporting the unusual adverse event 'Vulcan-green blood' it will be reported as: event.text of 'Vulcan-green blood', event.coding.display of 'Blood and lymphatic system disorders - Other, specify', and event.coding.code of NCIT code C143323."

Treatment technique may vary in uniform fractionation.\nIf the fractionation was uniform, then the correspondence between the physical and biologically effective dose can be determined at the course level.\nIf the fractionation was not uniform, then the correspondence between the physical and biologically effective dose has to be determined per the phase level.\nThe flag was introduced to support determination of whether fractionation was uniform when viewing the Radiotherapy Course Summary (without first checking the details of each treatment phase).\nThis is important in registry use cases to efficiently assess whether checking phase level information is needed."
