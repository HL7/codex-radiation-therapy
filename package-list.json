  "introduction": "The CodeX Radiation Therapy (RT) Implementation Guide (IG) describes how to represent, model, and exchange radiation therapy information that is generated during a patient's radiation therapy planning and treatment. This FHIR IG is intended for any individual involved in a patient's journey that would directly benefit from receiving radiation therapy information. The CodeX RT IG includes several radiotherapy profiles, based on existing FHIR resources, to represent the necessary radiation therapy concepts associated with patients' RT treatment. The goal is to capture all relevant information throughout the treatment process and make this information available for data sharing and reuse.",
